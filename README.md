# Description
Collection of my scripts, mostly used to save assets from Roblox experiences.
# Infinite Fun (Infinite Yield Mod)
If you're looking for Infinite Fun, it has its own repository, : ![Xane123/InfiniteFun_IY](https://github.com/Xane123/InfiniteFun_IY).
# How To Use
To run any of these scripts in your executor, paste this LoadString into a new script, then replace "[script filename]" with the script you want:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xane123/Roblox-Scripts/main/[script filename].lua'))()
```
For example, to start my main script, **Xane's Model Recreator**, use this LoadString, which also loads *API_Recreator.lua* as a dependency:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xane123/Roblox-Scripts/main/XanesModelRecreator.lua'))()
```
# License and Disclaimer
As of August 4th, 2024, all code included in this repository doesn't have a license, and therefore shouldn't be considered editable. You may run the scripts through LoadStrings and make use of the Recreation API (API_Recreation.lua) in your own scripts, though. You can also save anything you capture using my scripts, but since most assets will be saved from experiences that you don't own, you *shouldn't* leak or use them in your own experiences. I'm not responsible for any loss of reputation, experience takedowns, or other negative responses that you may receive if you do either of the things that were just mentioned.

Although these scripts can save models and assets from any game without permission, they could be used as references or guidelines for developers, or to save characters or structures players have created in games that are considered important enough to preserve. The user of this script determines whether they're using it for good or bad, and no blame should be given to me or the scripts.
